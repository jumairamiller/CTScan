# CTScan
Given a 3D dataset of a CT Head Scan, I made use of JavaFX and Graphics concepts and techniques - including image rendering, nearest neighbour resize, bilinear interpolation resize, Maximum intensity projection, and histogram equalization - to create an application which can be used to get a better view to analyse 3D volumes of medical data
